This is the logic I plan on using for this assignment. Then create a shared file. 

**Routine Name:**           quad

**Author:** Brandi

**Language:** Probably C 

For example,

    quad.py

will produce an executable **./a.exe** than can be executed. If you want a different name, the following will work a bit
better

    no sure yet

**Description/Purpose:** This routine will take values a,b,c then compute the quadratic equation. 

**Input:** In put variables are the coefficients to the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx +c

**Output:** This routine returns an array with two entries for when we add the square root of the discriminant and when we subtract the square root of the discriminant.


**Usage/Example:** information here

      call quad
      print*, a, b, c
Output from the lines above:

      soln1, soln2
      
**Implementation/Code:**
