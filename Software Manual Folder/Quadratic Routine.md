# Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics Software Manual
This is the logic I plan on using for this assignment.

**Routine Name:**           quad

**Author:** Brandi

**Language:** Probably C or python

For example,

    quad,a,b,c

will produce an executable **./a.exe** than can be executed. If you want a different name, the following will work a bit
better

    no sure yet

**Description/Purpose:** This routine will take values a,b,c then compute the quadratic equation. 

**Input:** In put variables are the coefficients to the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx +c

**Output:** This routine returns an array with two entries for when we add the square root of the discriminant and when we subtract the square root of the discriminant.


The code (if in python) will look approximately like this


    quad(a,b,c)
    quad,a,b,c
