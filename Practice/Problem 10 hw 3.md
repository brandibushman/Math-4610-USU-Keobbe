The Kronecker Prodcut is a kin to the outter product, so it uses two matricies and gives a block matrix. This is useful when dealing with permutation matricies and other special tyeps of matricies such as the Haddamard matrix and Heisenberg XXX model. Those are applied to atom field interactions and in quantized elctromagnetic fields specifically. It is also related to the tenstor product.  Essentially the Kronecker product is being used to help analyze cutting edge scienfic studies.
