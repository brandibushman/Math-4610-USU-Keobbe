### Problem 1 *
Write routines that will compute and return the [1 Norm*](https://github.com/brandibushman/Math-4610-USU-Keobbe/blob/master/Software%20Manual%20Folder/1%20Norm%20Lengths.md), [2 Norm*](https://github.com/brandibushman/Math-4610-USU-Keobbe/blob/master/Software%20Manual%20Folder/2%20Norm%20Lengths.md),  [infinity norm*](https://github.com/brandibushman/Math-4610-USU-Keobbe/blob/master/Software%20Manual%20Folder/Inf%20Norm%20Lengths.md) (lengths) of a given vector of arbitrary length. The routines should use as input, a vector and the length of the input vector and output a double value that is the length of the vector. Add the three routines to your software library. Add an entry in your software manual for each of the routines. Make sure that you include simple examples illustrating the usage of the functions/methods you have corrected.



### Problem 2 
Write routines that will compute the absolute and relative errors in the approximation of an "exact" vector and a vector used to approximate the exact vector. The routines should take as input two vectors, x and y, and the length of the two vectors. The output should be a single double value that represents the error. Note that there are six total routines that need to be developed. There are three measures of error for both the absolute error and three for the relative error. The three routines should compute the errors in the norms as defined in the previous problem. As usual, add entries to your software manual with simple examples.
[One Norm Abs*](https://github.com/brandibushman/Math-4610-USU-Keobbe/blob/master/Software%20Manual%20Folder/One%20Norm%20Abs.md), [One Norm Rel*](https://github.com/brandibushman/Math-4610-USU-Keobbe/blob/master/Software%20Manual%20Folder/One%20Norm%20Rel.md), [Two Norm Abs*](https://github.com/brandibushman/Math-4610-USU-Keobbe/blob/master/Software%20Manual%20Folder/Two%20Norm%20Abs.md), [Two Norm Rel*](https://github.com/brandibushman/Math-4610-USU-Keobbe/blob/master/Software%20Manual%20Folder/Two%20Norm%20Rel.md), [Infinity Norm Abs](https://github.com/brandibushman/Math-4610-USU-Keobbe/blob/master/Software%20Manual%20Folder/Infinity%20Norm%20Abs.md), [Infinity Norm Rel](https://github.com/brandibushman/Math-4610-USU-Keobbe/blob/master/Software%20Manual%20Folder/Infinity%20Norm%20Rel.md)

You do not need to add an entry to the software manual in this case. However, you need to give examples to verify your code works.
