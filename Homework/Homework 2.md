### Problem 1

Write routines that can be used to compute the 
[Absolute Error](https://github.com/brandibushman/Math-4610-USU-Keobbe/blob/master/Software%20Manual%20Folder/Absolute%20Error.md) and the [Relative Error](https://github.com/brandibushman/Math-4610-USU-Keobbe/blob/master/Software%20Manual%20Folder/Relative%20Error.md)
between a machine precision number, 
x
, and an "exact" value, 
y
. The output should be a single number of type double. Note that you should be considering the efficiency of the routines you write. So, do not use branching statements to write one routine to implement these types of algorithms in a single routine. Conditional statements should be avoided in terms of efficiency. Add the two routines to the software manual you are building throughout the semester and add the routines to your shared libraries.

### [Problem 2](https://github.com/brandibushman/Math-4610-USU-Keobbe/blob/master/Practice/Maybe%20problem%202.2.md)

In this problem, you will investigate problems that occur due to finite precision of arithmetic. In the text, one standard approximation for derivatives involves the definition. The approximation is used in many application.


### Problem  3

Sometimes a formula can be modified to mitigate issues related to machine precision computations.
Above, an approximation of the derivative. Use the derivative approximation using to examine machine precision errors as 
h
 tends to zero. Then use the conjugate of the numerator to rewrite the derivative formula using the following steps:
